# Bazar AI

An AI-assisted grocery shopping experience for the Bangladeshi market — tell it what you're cooking, and it fills your cart with real, in-stock products.

This repo is being built in stages.

## Data pipeline

1. **Scrape** — a polite, `robots.txt`-compliant scrape of Shwapno.com, a real Bangladeshi grocery retailer (`scrapper/scraper.py`). Product listings are client-side rendered, so this uses Playwright (headless Chromium) rather than a plain HTTP fetch, scraping category pages via infinite scroll in batches instead of one request per product. Honest `User-Agent`, 2-second minimum delay between page loads, no `/api*` paths or query strings touched.
2. **Transform** — `scrapper/transform_to_seed.py` cleans the raw scrape into a ready-to-seed catalog: dedupes by product URL, parses unit/size out of each product name, and assigns stock levels (mostly randomized, with a few products deliberately forced out of stock to exercise the AI assistant's substitution logic later on). Bangla names are left blank — not scraped yet.

Output: `backend/seed/seed_data.json`, the catalog the backend seeds its database from.

## Bazar Buddy, the AI shopping assistant

The differentiator: a function-calling agent, not a Q&A chatbot. Tell it what you're cooking ("morog polao for 6", "biryani under 1500 taka") and it interprets the request, matches ingredients against the real catalog, and fills your cart — substituting or honestly skipping whatever's out of stock.

- **LLM layer** (`backend/core/llm.py`) — Gemini as the primary provider, Groq as an automatic fallback on rate-limit errors, and a local cache so an identical prompt never costs a second API call.
- **Agent** (`backend/agent/`) — one LLM call per message turns free text into structured JSON (intent, dish, ingredients, quantities); everything after that — matching against the catalog, stock checks, substitutions, budget-fitting, the reply text — is deterministic code, not a second model call. The core design principle: the LLM decides *what* the customer wants, plain code decides the *facts* (price, stock, which real product).

## Backend

FastAPI, fully async (SQLAlchemy 2.0 `AsyncSession` end to end), Postgres in production / SQLite locally via one `DATABASE_URL` swap, Alembic migrations.

- **Auth** — JWT bearer tokens, bcrypt password hashing (thread-pooled so it never blocks the async event loop).
- **Products** — paginated listing, category filter, search.
- **Cart** — add/update/remove, always re-validated against live stock.
- **Orders** — checkout snapshots price and product name onto each order line (so order history stays readable even if a product's price or listing changes later), decrements stock, and clears the cart in one transaction.
